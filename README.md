- 👋 Hi, I’m @Cachemarra, a Python programmer focus on Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Computer Vision.
I'll use this space to upload projects and learning courses and my own projects. If the repository is public, feel free to clone it, I hope 
it will help you.
- 👀 As I stated before, I’m interested in Deep Learning and Computer Vision, but also in Embedded Systems, Machine Learning and Data Scraping. 
There's always something new to learn and I'm doing my best to get better and better.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning CI/CD, Testing, MLOPS, Data Science, PyTorch and Web and there will be more things in the future!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anyone willing to create and brind to the humanity. I'm a big devote of Open Source software, and I'm trying to
make free most of my projects.
